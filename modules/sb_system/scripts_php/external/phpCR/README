Introduction
============
The PHP Content Repository standard, or phpCR, provides a standard set of 
interfaces for the developer to implement.  The manner of implementation has no
effect, the developer is only bound to provide the following classes/methods to
access the underlying data.  Any PHP program that stores data can implement this
API.  Examples include:

 * Filesystem
 * Document repository
 * Content Management System
 * Blog
 * Wiki
 * Gallery
 * Forum
 * XML Document structures (see spec PDF for example)

Of course, the underlying structure is left up to the developer's imagination
and/or needs.


What is phpCR?
==============
phpCR is a collection of interfaces[1] that provide a developer with a series
of "contracts" by which he will implement his API.  This eases the process of
integrating multiple solutions, as a new API the 3rd-party developer does not
need to learn a new API in order to utilize new software.

phpCR does *not* provide any implementation of the systems mentioned in the 
introduction.  This package is intended only for those who program using PHP or
are interested in using PHP interfaces for a learning process.

Specifications
==============

For full information about the JSR-170 specification, see the file located at:
    /spec/jsr170-0.12.pdf 
in the archive.  If you did not receive this file, it can be downloaded from
    https://svn.domain51.net/svn/NonOriginal/pr-jsr-170/spec/jsr170-0.12.pdf


PHP Specifics
=============
Translation from one spoken language to another is rarely a scientific
occurence.  Contrary to popular belief among mono-lingual individuals, there is
a lot of room for interpetation.  Computer languages, while their translations
are more specific, some interpetation is required on the part of the tranlsator.
While phpCR is based primarly on the JCR, there are areas where things differ.

During this first draft, every attempt has been made to stay as close to the 
original JCR specification as possible.  If you feel something has been lost in
the translation, please feel free to contact Travis Swicegood at the address 
given in the Contact Information section.


Roadmap
=======
v0.1: Initial release offering a straight translation of JSR-170, JCR.
v0.2 - v0.5: Fix and updates to the API to make it more PHP compatible.
v0.6 - v0.9: Finalization of code, add a PHP specifications document, add to 
    existing API documentation.
v1.0: Final release, full documentation, examples, etc.

Beyond v1.0: Once phpCR has reached full maturity as a PHP library, the intent
    is to explore adding it as part of the Standard PHP Library, or SPL.
    See http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/ for full information on SPL.


Download Information
====================
The latest version of phpCR will always be available via Subversion at:
    https://svn.domain51.net/svn/phpCR

A SourceForge project page may be in the future.  

Please note that the 'phpcr' project at SourceForge  and the 'php-170' project
at ThinkForge are not related to this project.  As best as could be determined
when this project was undertaken by Travis Swicegood, both projects were dead.


Contact Information
===================
Questions regarding phpCR can be directed to:
    Travis Swicegood, <travis@domain51.net>

Travis Swicegood or Domain51 can not answer questions regarding specific 
implements of phpCR.  If you are using a software package that has implemented
phpCR and require support, we suggest you contact the developer of the specific
application directly.
