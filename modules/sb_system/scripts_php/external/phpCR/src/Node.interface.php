	 * Completes the merge process with respect to this node and the specified <i>version</i>.
	 *
	 * When the {@link merge()} method is called on a node, every versionable node in that
	 * subtree is compared with its corresponding node in the indicated other workspace and
	 * a "merge test result" is determined indicating one of the following:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>
	 * This node will be updated to the state of its correspondee (if the base version
	 * of the correspondee is more recent in terms of version history)
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * This node will be left alone (if this node's base version is more recent in terms of
	 * version history).
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * This node will be marked as having failed the merge test (if this node's base version
	 * is on a different branch of the version history from the base version of its
	 * corresponding node in the other workspace, thus preventing an automatic determination
	 * of which is more recent).
	 * </li>
	 * </ol>
	 * (See {@link merge()} for more details)
	 *
	 * In the last case the merge of the non-versionable subtree
	 * (the "content") of this node must be done by the application (for example, by
	 * providing a merge tool for the user).
	 *
	 * Additionally, once the content of the nodes has been merged, their version graph
	 * branches must also be merged. The JCR versioning system provides for this by
	 * keeping a record, for each versionable node that fails the merge test, of the
	 * base verison of the corresponding node that caused the merge failure. This record
	 * is kept in the <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> property of this node. After a
	 * {@link merge()}, this property will contain one or more (if
	 * multiple merges have been performed) <i>REFERENCE</i>s that point
	 * to the "offending versions".
	 *
	 * To complete the merge process, the client calls {@link doneMerge()}
	 * passing the version object referred to be the <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> property
	 * that the client wishes to connect to <i>this</i> node in the version graph.
	 * This has the effect of moving the reference to the indicated version from the
	 * <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> property of <i>this</i> node to the
	 * <i>jcr:predecessors</i>.
	 *
	 * If the client chooses not to connect this node to a particular version referenced in
	 * the <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> property, he calls {@link #cancelMerge(Version version)}.
	 * This has the effect of removing the reference to the specified <i>version</i> from
	 * <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> <i>without</i> adding it to <i>jcr:predecessors</i>.
	 *
	 * Once the last reference in <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> has been either moved to
	 * <i>jcr:predecessors</i> (with <i>doneMerge</i>) or just removed
	 * from <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i> (with <i>cancelMerge</i>) the <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i>
	 * property is automatically removed, thus enabling <i>this</i>
	 * node to be checked-in, creating a new version (note that before the <i>jcr:mergeFailed</i>
	 * is removed, its <i>OnParentVersion</i> setting of <i>ABORT</i> prevents checkin).
	 * This new version will have a predecessor connection to each version for which <i>doneMerge</i>
	 * was called, thus joining those branches of the version graph.
	 *
	 * If successful, these changes are persisted immediately,
	 * there is no need to call {@link save()}.
