	/**
	 * Returns an <i>org.xml.sax.ContentHandler</i> which can be used to

	 * form of SAX events) does not appear to be a JCR <i>system view</i> XML
	 * document then it is interpreted as a JCR <i>document view</i> XML
	 * document.
	 *
	 * The incoming XML is deserialized into a subtree of items immediately
	 * below the node at <i>parentAbsPath</i>.
	 *
	 * This method simply returns the <i>ContentHandler</i> without
	 * altering the state of the session; the actual deserialization to the
	 * session transient space is done through the methods of the
	 * <i>ContentHandler</i>. Invalid XML data
	 * will cause the <i>ContentHandler</i> to throw a
	 * {@link SAXException}.
	 *
	 * As SAX events are fed into the <i>ContentHandler</i>, the tree of
	 * new items is built in the transient storage of the session. In order to
	 * persist the new content, {@link save()} must be called. The advantage
	 * of this through-the-session method is that (depending on which constraint
	 * checks the implementation leaves until {@link save()}) structures that
	 * violate node type constraints can be imported, fixed and then saved. The
	 * disadvantage is that a large import will result in a large cache of
	 * pending nodes in the session. See
	 * {@link Workspace::getImportContentHandler()} for a version of this
	 * method that does not go through the session.
	 *
	 * The flag <i>uuidBehavior</i> governs how the UUIDs of incoming
	 * (deserialized) nodes are handled. There are four options:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW}: Incoming referenceable
	 * nodes are added in the same way that new node is added with
	 * <i>Node.addNode</i>. That is, they are either assigned newly
	 * created UUIDs upon addition or upon {@link save()} (depending on the
	 * implementation). In either case, UUID collisions will not occur.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING}: If an
	 * incoming referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing
	 * in the workspace then the already existing node (and its subtree) is
	 * removed from wherever it may be in the workspace before the incoming node
	 * is added. Note that this can result in nodes �disappearing� from
	 * locations in the workspace that are remote from the location to which the
	 * incoming subtree is being written. Both the removal and the new addition
	 * will be persisted on {@link save()}.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING}: If an
	 * incoming referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing
	 * in the workspace, then the already-existing node is replaced by the
	 * incoming node in the same position as the existing node. Note that this
	 * may result in the incoming subtree being disaggregated and �spread
	 * around� to different locations in the workspace. In the most extreme case
	 * this behavior may result in no node at all being added as child of
	 * <i>parentAbsPath</i>. This will occur if the topmost element of the
	 * incoming XML has the same UUID as an existing node elsewhere in the
	 * workspace. The change will be persisted on {@link save()}.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW}: If an incoming
	 * referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the
	 * workspace then a {@link SAXException} is thrown by the
	 * <i>ContentHandler</i> during deserialization.
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Unlike <i>Workspace.getImportContentHandler</i>, this method does not necessarily
	 * enforce all node type constraints during deserialization. Those that
	 * would be immediately enforced in a normal write method (<i>Node.addNode</i>,
	 * <i>Node.setProperty</i> etc.) of this implementation cause the returned
	 * <i>ContentHandler</i> to throw an immediate {@link SAXException} during deserialization.
	 * All other constraints are checked on save, just as they are in normal
	 * write operations. However, which node type constraints are enforced depends upon whether node type
	 * information in the imported data is respected, and this is an implementation-specific issue.
	 *
	 * A {@link SAXException} will also be thrown by the returned
	 * <i>ContentHandler</i> during deserialization if <i>uuidBehavior</i> is set to
	 * <i>IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING</i> and an incoming node has the same
	 * UUID as the node at <i>parentAbsPath</i> or one of its ancestors.
	 *
	 * A {@link PathNotFoundException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()}
	 * if no node exists at <i>parentAbsPath</i>. Implementations may differ on when this
	 * validation is performed
	 *
	 * A {@link ConstraintViolationException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()}
	 * if the new subtree cannot be added to the node at parentAbsPath due to node-type or other
	 * implementation-specific constraints, and this can be determined before the first SAX event is sent.
	 * Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
	 *
	 * A {@link VersionException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()} if the node at
	 * <i>parentAbsPath</i> is versionable and checked-in, or is non-versionable but
	 * its nearest versionable ancestor is checked-in. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.

	/**
	 * Deserializes an XML document and adds the resulting item subtree as a

	 *
	 * If the incoming XML stream does not appear to be a JCR <i>system view</i>
	 * XML document then it is interpreted as a <i>document view</i> XML
	 * document.
	 *
	 * The tree of new items is built in the transient storage of the Session.
	 * In order to persist the new content, {@link save()} must be called.
	 * The advantage of this through-the-session method is that (depending on
	 * what constraint checks the implementation leaves until {@link save()})
	 * structures that violate node type constraints can be imported, fixed and
	 * then saved. The disadvantage is that a large import will result in a
	 * large cache of pending nodes in the session. See {@link
	 * Workspace#importXML} for a version of this method that does not go
	 * through the {@link Session}.
	 *
	 * The flag <i>uuidBehavior</i> governs how the UUIDs of incoming
	 * (deserialized) nodes are handled. There are four options:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW}: Incoming referenceable nodes
	 * are added in the same way that new node is added with
	 * <i>Node.addNode</i>. That is, they are either assigned newly
	 * created UUIDs upon addition or upon {@link save()} (depending on the
	 * implementation). In either case, UUID collisions will not occur.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING}: If an incoming
	 * referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the
	 * workspace then the already existing node (and its subtree) is removed
	 * from wherever it may be in the workspace before the incoming node is
	 * added. Note that this can result in nodes �disappearing� from locations
	 * in the workspace that are remote from the location to which the incoming
	 * subtree is being written. Both the removal and the new addition will be
	 * persisted on {@link save()}.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING}: If an incoming
	 * referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the
	 * workspace, then the already-existing node is replaced by the incoming
	 * node in the same position as the existing node. Note that this may result
	 * in the incoming subtree being disaggregated and �spread around� to
	 * different locations in the workspace. In the most extreme case this
	 * behavior may result in no node at all being added as child of
	 * <i>parentAbsPath</i>. This will occur if the topmost element of the
	 * incoming XML has the same UUID as an existing node elsewhere in the
	 * workspace. The change will only be persisted on {@link save()}.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * {@link ImportUUIDBehavior#IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW}: If an incoming
	 * referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the
	 * workspace then an {@link ItemExistsException} is thrown.
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Unlike {@link Workspace::importXML()}, this method does not necessarily
	 * enforce all node type constraints during deserialization. Those that
	 * would be immediately enforced in a normal write method
	 * (<i>Node.addNode</i>, <i>Node.setProperty</i> etc.) of this
	 * implementation cause an immediate
	 * {@link ConstraintViolationException} during deserialization. All
	 * other constraints are checked on {@link save()}, just as they are in
	 * normal write operations. However, which node type constraints are enforced
	 * depends upon whether node type information in the imported data is respected,
	 * and this is an implementation-specific issue.
	 *
	 * A {@link ConstraintViolationException} will also be thrown
	 * immediately if <i>uuidBehavior</i> is set to
	 * <i>IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING</i> and an incoming node
	 * has the same UUID as the node at <i>parentAbsPath</i> or one of its
	 * ancestors.
	 *
	 * A {@link PathNotFoundException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()}
	 * if no node exists at <i>parentAbsPath</i>. Implementations may differ on when this
	 * validation is performed
	 *
	 * A {@link ConstraintViolationException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()}
	 * if the new subtree cannot be added to the node at parentAbsPath due to node-type or other
	 * implementation-specific constraints, and this can be determined before the first SAX event is sent.
	 * Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
	 *
	 * A {@link VersionException} is thrown either immediately or on {@link save()} if the node at
	 * <i>parentAbsPath</i> is versionable and checked-in, or is non-versionable but
	 * its nearest versionable ancestor is checked-in. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
