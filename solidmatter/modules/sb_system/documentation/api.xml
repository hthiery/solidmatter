			<subsection title="Rough Comparison JCR vs. sbCR" id="">
				- compromise between speed and JCR compatibility
				- DB backed, access possible aside JCR API

			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section title="JCR vs. sbCR (Restrictions)" id="jcrsbcr">
			<subsection title="Workspaces" id="">
				- only one workspace
				- more workspaces supported, but not connected
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Permissions" id="">
				- no session-level permissions
				- but user-level authorisations
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Same Name Siblings" id="">
				- does not support same name siblings
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Shared Sets" id="">
				<p>
					sbCR supports shared nodes according to the JCR API. However, they always have the same name as it is stored in the node itself, and nodes are managed separately from the workspace hierarchy.
				</p>
				<caution>
					As there is only one instance of a node created in the repository, a name change applies to all nodes in the shared set.
				</caution>
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Mixin Types" id="mixin">
				<p>
					All nodes have (at least) the following mixin types:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>mix:created</li>
					<li>mix:lastModified</li>
					<li>mix:referencable</li>
					<li>mix:referencable</li>
					<li>mix:lockable</li>
					<li>mix:referencable</li>
					<li>sb:deleted</li>
					<li>sb:node</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Properties" id="">
				<p>
					Because of the mandatory mixin types, several properties are mandatory.
				</p>
				<caution>sbCR properties are currently NOT handled as repository items!
					Instead, properties obtained via getProperty() and the like are treated as scalar php variable types.
					This is mainly for performance reasons and for easier handling

		<section title="Views and Actions" id="concept">
			<subsection title="Content vs. Application Logic?" id="contentlogic">
				<p>
					JCR itself only deals with the data structures stored in the repository, and to some extent also with the content logic (via constraints, references and the like).
					sbCR uses a slightly different approach, it also couples application logic with the nodes.
					This is achieved by describing the different actions that can be 'called' upon the nodes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Actions are what drives any application, may it be the click on a button/link or submitting of a form.
					Every action results in a request sent to the server which sends a corresponding response.
					In a REST environment like the web, everything is built of actions a user can take, even if they are called (periodically) by an AJAX event.
				</p>
				<p>
					The application design should be built according to this premise.
					You are free to use a different approach (TODO: see other chapters), but it is strongly recommended that you describe the objects of the application domain in terms of data and logic.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="What is a View?" id="view">
				<p>
					A view in itself is first and formeost nothing more than a conceptual idea of different means to approach an object.
					For example, think of a folder in an operating system: you can list the files contained in the folder, you can view them in a thumbnail view, or you could take a look at the folder properties.
					This is the exact same object-centric approach solidMatter uses to build up an application.
					But it doesn't stop there, a view may use several actions, e.g. a folder's properties may be displayed, edited or saved.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the application context, views provide a way to group actions together logically, but also in regard of the codebase.
					Usually, there is one class for each view, and this class handles all actions that can called upon a node.
				</p>
				<info>
					Each view defined on a nodetype MAY be displayed in the backend automatically (as a flag TODO: consider authorisation).
					This doesn't make sense on all possible views, so it's up to you to decide which views should be invisible, and what's the most sensible order to display the views in.

			<subsection id="samp_think" title="Think...">
				<p>
					So, what are you trying to achieve?
					You want to build a simple blog, therefore the required functionality is easily imaginable:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Admins should be able to create, edit and delete blog entries</li>
					<li>Readers should be able to comment</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There's also a small, well defined set of things you deal with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Blog entries</li>
					<li>Comments</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			<subsection id="samp_objects" title="Application Domain Objects">
				<p>
					In order to build this application, you have to model the domain objects you are dealing with, as well as the operations performed on them.
					So let's take a look at the details...
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple blog entry should at least contain the following information:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the title</li>
					<li>the content</li>
					<li>the creator (if we assume it's a blog run by several people)</li>
					<li>the date and time the post was created</li>
					<li>a unique identifier</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					It should also be viewable, editable, and deletable by the admins in terms of use cases.
					Also anyone can view an entry in the blog.
				</p>
				<p>
					A comment has even less information attached to it in the simplest version:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the comment itself</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In terms of functionality, anyone can post a comment, and admins should be able to view, edit and delete comments.
				</p>
				<p>
					As we have seen, there are two objects in the applications domain we have to model.
					But wait, haven't we forgot something?
					As solidMatter is able to run several blogs, we have to model the application itself, too.
					This is just as easy, a blog doesn't need much information for a start:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a title</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The blog itself should be able to list all entries, so you can click on a topic and view all details and comments.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection id="samp_next" title="Next Step">
				<p>
					So now you know what you're dealing with.
					Ideally, you'd now write down all requirements and think about details e.g., how long may a blog entry get?
					But we want to get something on the screen, so we'll skip this part and deal with the details later.
					Time to move to the implementation...
				</p>
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section id="samp_prepare" title="Preparation">
			<p>
				As you are implementing a new application and not an extension module, you have to put all new stuff into a new namespace to seperate it from the other modules.
				Namespaces should start with a lowercase prefix that applies only to one entity (a person, a company, an organisation).
				Remember, you might not be the only one creating a blog application, e.g. all modules "owned" by the solidMatter project will start with "sb" (for "solidbytes").
				"my" would be a badly chosen prefix in reality, but let's just call the application "myBlog" for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				So you got the namespace, but you need a 'safe' name (all lowercase plus underscore) for it, too.
				This would be "my_blog" according to the guidelines.
			</p>
			<p>
				A module has to provide several mandatory things, e.g. you have to store the scripts, locales etc. in specific folders.
			</p>
			<action>
				Create the following folders:
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;solidMatter&gt;/modules/my_blog</li>
					<li>&lt;solidMatter&gt;/modules/my_blog/scripts_php</li>
					<li>&lt;solidMatter&gt;/interface/locales/my_blog</li>
					<li>&lt;solidMatter&gt;/interface/themes/_default/my_blog/</li>
					<li>&lt;solidMatter&gt;/interface/themes/_default/my_blog/xsl/</li>
				</ul>
			</action>	
			<info>
				You might need to create more folders depending on what you need to provide (custom icons, CSS stylesheets and the like).
				More details on the default directory structure can be found in $CHAPTER
			</info>
		</section>
		<section id="samp_repository" title="Setting up the Repository items">
			<p>
				The necessary repository set-up is done best in these steps (subject to change, when we support the JCR API for repository administration):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>creating the nodetypes</li>
				<li>creating the nodetype's properties</li>
				<li>creating the nodetype's views</li>
				<li>creating the nodetype's actions</li>
				<li>associating modes with the nodetypes</li>
				<li>more...</li>
			</ul>
			<subsection id="samp_nodetypes" title="Nodetypes">
				<p>
					First, you should create the nodetypes for your application. Luckily, there is already a comment nodetype that meets our expectations, sbSystem:Comment, so we'll leave that one out.
				</p>
				<info>
					In order to not interfere with other modules, you might like to build your own comment nodetype, just in case requirements change and you need things the internal comment doesn't provide.
				</info>
				<action>
					Insert the following entries into the nodetypes table:
					<ul>
						<li>myBlog:Blog</li>
						<li>myBlog:Entry</li>
					</ul>
				</action>
			</subsection>
			<subsection id="samp_properties" title="Properties">
				<p>
					Next on the list should be the properties that are associated with the nodetypes.
					Again, luckily solidMatter provides us with a set of prepared set of properties (see $CHAPTER).
					As the nodetype already stores most of the needed information, we are just left with the content property.
				</p>
				<action>
					Insert the following entries into the properties table:
					<ul>
						<li>myBlog:Entry content</li>
					</ul>
				</action>
			</subsection>
			<subsection id="samp_views" title="Views">
				
				<action>
					Insert the following entries into the views table:
					<ul>
						<li>myBlog:Blog properties</li>
						<li>myBlog:Blog index</li>
						<li>myBlog:Entry properties</li>
						<li>myBlog:Entry comments</li>

	<chapter title="Coding Guidelines" id="codingguidelines">
		<p>
			In order to keep the code readable and consistent, there are a number of coding guidelines described in this chapter.
			You MUST stick to these rules if you are contributing to the solidMatter core or any of the sb*-modules (provided by respectively under development lead by solidbytes). 
			You SHOULD stick to these rules if you are developing a 3rd-party-module for solidMatter.
		</p>
		<info>
			Rules exist to be broken. No, seriously, there are exceptions from these rules, but keep in mind that they are very rare, and MUST serve the readability or have a really good reason.
		</info>
		<section title="Versioning" id="code_versioning">
			<p>
				There are 5 types of versions to be maintained in solidMatter, Module- resp. release-, API-, locale-, theme- and file-versions.
				Versioning uses a fixed scheme, which MUST be followed even for 3rd-party-modules.
				The scheme contains information on major version, features, bugfixes and release states.
				Module (=release), API, locale and theme versions are not coupled in any way to source code versions.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Version: 0-# (# is not limited)</li>
				<li>Subversion: 00-99 (increased with every release that contains added features or API changes)</li>
				<li>Bugfixversion: 00-99 (increased with every release that contains bugfixes, this number is reset on changes to version or subversion)</li>
				<li>Release State (optional): one of the following - alpha, beta, rc# (# is not limited)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Examples:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0.04.02alpha</li>
				<li>1.00.00</li>
				<li>1.02.04beta</li>
				<li>1.02.07rc2</li>
				<li>1.05.13</li>
				<li>12.08.00</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section title="Variable Naming" id="variablenaming">
			<p>Variables SHOULD always indicate their proposed type as lowercase prefix, followed by the self explanatory name: "$prefixSelfExplanatoryName".
			The well-known Prefixes for scalar types are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>i: Integer</li>
				<li>s: String</li>
				<li>f: Float</li>
				<li>a: Array</li>
				<li>h: Ressource Handle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For objects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>node: sbNode or sbCRNode</li>
				<li>ni: sbNodeIterator</li>
				<li>cache: any kind of cache object</li>
				<li>elem: DOMElement</li>
				<li>dom: DOMDocument or derived class</li>
				<li>form: sbDOMForm</li>
				<li>view: sbView or derived class</li>
				<li>o: unknown/unspecified object</li>
			</ul>
			<info>
				Exceptions:
				<ul>
					<li>$_REQUEST/$_RESPONSE: global request/response in solidMatter</li>
					<li>$i, $j, etc.: loop iterators</li>
					<li>$e: catched exception</li>

		<section title="Code Formatting" id="codeformatting">
			<subsection title="Indenting" id="">
				<p>
					Indenting SHOULD always be done according to best-practices (indenting codeblocks) using tabs.
					Each tab uses the equivalent space to 4 spaces.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection title="Bracketing" id="">
				<p>
					All code blocks SHOULD be contained in brackets, even if they only consist of one command.
					The opening bracket SHOULD be on the same line as the control flow structure (for, if, while...).
				</p>
				<code>// Correct
while (!$asleep) {
	$sheep++;
}
					
// Wrong
while (!$asleep)
{
	$sheep++;
}
while (!$asleep)
	$sheep++;</code>
