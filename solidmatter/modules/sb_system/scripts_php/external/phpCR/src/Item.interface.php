	 * When an item is saved the item in persistent storage to which pending

	 *
	 * As a result of these rules, a {@link save()} of an item that has a 
	 * UUID will succeed even if that item has, in the meantime, been moved in
	 * persistent storage to a new location (that is, its path has changed). 
	 * However, a {@link save()} of a non-UUID item will fail (throwing an
	 * <i>InvalidItemStateException</i>) if it has, in the meantime, been 
	 * moved in persistent storage to a new location. A {@link save()} of a
	 * non-UUID item will also fail if it has, in addition to being moved, been
	 * replaced in its original position by a UUID-bearing item.
