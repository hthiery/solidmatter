	/**
	 * Adds an event listener that listens for the specified $eventTypes (a
	 * combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value).
	 *
	 * The set of events can be filtered by specifying restrictions based on 
	 * characteristics of the node associated with the event. In the case of 
	 * event types {@link Event::NODE_ADDED} and {@link Event::NODE_REMOVED},
	 * the node associated with an event is the node at (or formerly at) the 
	 * path returned by {@link Event.getPath()}.  In the case of event types 
	 * {@link Event::PROPERTY_ADDED}, {@link Event::PROPERTY_REMOVED} and
	 * {@link Event::PROPERTY_CHANGED}, the node associated with an event is 
	 * the parent node of the property at (or formerly at) the path returned by
	 * {@link Event.getPath()}:
	 * <ul>
	 *    <li>
	 *	      <i>$absPath</i>, <i>$isDeep</i>: Only events whose 
	 *        associated node is at <i>$absPath</i> (or within its 
	 *        subtree, if <i>isDeep</i> is <i>true</i>) will be
	 *        received.  It is permissible to register a listener for a path 
	 *        where no node currently exists.
	 *    </li>
	 *    <li>
	 *	      <i>$uuid</i>: Only events whose associated node has one of
	 *        the UUIDs in this list will be received.  If his parameter is
	 *        NULL then no UUID-related restriction is placed on events 
	 *        received.
	 *    </li>
	 *    <li>
	 * 	      <i>$nodeTypeName</i>: Only events whose associated node 
	 *        has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types)
	 *        in this list will be received. If his parameter is NULL then no 
	 *        node type-related restriction is placed on events received.
	 *    </li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * The restrictions are "ANDed" together. In other words, for a particular 
	 * node to be "listened to" it must meet all the restrictions.
	 *
	 * Additionally, if <i>$noLocal</i> is TRUE, then events generated 
	 * by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. 
	 * Otherwise, they are not ignored.
	 *
	 * The filters of an already-registered {@link EventListener} can be
	 * changed at runtime by re-registering the same {@link EventListener}
	 * object (i.e. the same actual Java object) with a new set of filter
	 * arguments.  The implementation must ensure that no events are lost
	 * during the changeover.
	 *
	 * @param object
	 *	an {@link EventListener} object.
	 * @param int 
	 *	A combination of one or more event type constants encoded as a bitmask.
	 * @param string 
	 *	An absolute path.
	 * @param boolean
	 * @param array
	 *	Array of UUIDs.
	 * @param array
	 *	Array of node type names.
	 * @param boolean
	 *
	 * @throws {@link RepositoryException}
	 *	If an error occurs.
