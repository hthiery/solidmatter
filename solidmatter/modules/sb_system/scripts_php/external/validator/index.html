<h1>TWINE: Toolkit for Web-Interface Evaluation</h1>


<h2>Why this toolkit?</h2>

<p>Ever had to validate the HTML produced by your web application against the 
HTML DTD orcheck it for Web Accessibility issues? With static HTML files, 
this is a snap: just include a link to a validation service like the 
<a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C's Markup Validation Service</a> and 
fill in the URL.  There are even browser toolbars and other client-side 
tools that can automatically submit pages to these services.</p>

<p>But this is not possible with many web apps.  Two common problems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>authentication and authorization code will block out non-authorized 
  requests--<em>like the one coming from the validation service!</em></li> 
  <li>the page is written by a script that requires an HTTP post 
  (not a great development practice, but quite frequent)</li>
</ul>

<p>In this situation, your only option is to validate manually: a 
repetitive series of "View Source" and "Save to file" operations 
in your web browser, 
followed by submitting these files to a validation service.  And 
since your web application is <em>dynamic</em>, it is possible 
that another version of this interface will still contain bad markup.
</p>

<p>This process needs to be easier.  How about just clicking a button?  
That's what this toolkit is designed to allow you to do.</p>


<h2>Who cares--just show me the software!</h2>

<p>If you just want to get started, go to the 
<a href="doc/javahtml.html">HTML Validator for Java</a>.
It is very easy to use--just drop it in to your web app and modify 
your web.xml configuration file.  It will report HTML validation problems
on all your web interfaces. 

<h2>More boring technical details please!</h2>

<p>Basically, this toolkit works server-side to make it possible to validate dynamic resources in almost any situation.  To do this, it takes dynamic HTTP requests and writes them out as static
HTML files that can be validated just like a hard-coded HTML page.  It does this by
intercepting and buffering the <em>dynamic</em> output of your web app, writing the results to disk, then writing a link that will submit the <em>static</em> resource to the validation service.</p>

<p>Check out a <a href="doc/diagram.html"target="newWindow" onclick="window.open(this.href,
this.target, 'scrollbars=yes, resizable=yes,width=450,height=500,'); return
true">diagram</a>.</p>


<h2>Validation Services</h2>

<p>
By default these components submit the dynamic resource to the W3C HTML validation service at:
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>.  There are many other validation 
services out there, some free, some not.  A popular Web
accessibiliy validation service is WAVE, and WAVE can validate your web interfaces against 
US Section 508 and WCAG Guidelines.  WAVE can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.wave.webaim.org">http://www.wave.webaim.org</a>.
